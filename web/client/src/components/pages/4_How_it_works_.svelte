        To take 100% entertainment of MeowRun, there are a few game tips in playing. One, avoid enemy and
        keep your health. When hit by enemy or the enemy's attack, player health will decrease. Two, get familiar
        with map. Map can be your biggest supporter or cruel enemy. Search where you can hide from enemy and
        find a portal to move to clear game. Three, collect items that help you through to clear game. Each item 
        has a different game effect - use it wisely!
